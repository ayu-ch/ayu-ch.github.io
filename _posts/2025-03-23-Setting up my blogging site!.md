# Welcome to my blog!

Hey,  
I'm Ayush
This site is going to be my little garden where I’ll be planting thoughts, nurturing ideas, and watching my learnings grow — whether it’s something technical, a life-lesson, or just a cool idea I came across :))

Whether you're just starting out or have been exploring your own path for a while, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Feel free to drop your thoughts, feedback or suggestions via mail. I'd love to hear from you!
