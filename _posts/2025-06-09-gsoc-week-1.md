# GSoC : Week 1

As I talked in my previous blog, I sent two patches to the mailing list:

- **[environment: move access to "core.sparsecheckout" into repo_settings](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250603131806.14915-1-ayu.chandekar@gmail.com)** : This patch removes the global variable `core_apply_sparse_checkout` and shifts the setting to repo_settings under the variable `sparse_checkout`. I got reviews for this patch to change the name and make some changes in the getter/setter function for which I sent v2 of the patch. I also got a new review to add range-diff and also to mention and thank the reviewers in the cover-letter. So will send a v3 of the patch for that. 
- **[builtin/prune: remove dependency on global variables and 'the_repository'](https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1749343601.git.ayu.chandekar@gmail.com)** : This patch removes dependency on global variables and `the_repository` from "builtin/prune.c". This patch didn't get any review yet.


This week, I focused on removing the global variables `comment_line_str`, `comment_line_str_to_free` and `auto_comment_line_char`, aiming to replace them with a functions which uses `repo_config_get_string_tmp()` from `config.c`. 

There was one specific test case which kept on failing: when `core.commentchar` is set to `auto` and we try to amend a commit message that begins with `#foo`. Previously, this relied on the global `comment_line_str`. To replace that, I needed a way to pass the computed prefix through various functions. My new function accepts a `strbuf` containing the commit message, analyzes it, and returns the appropriate prefix. However, in several call sites, it's not feasible to pass the `strbuf` directly, which leads to incorrect prefix computation. To work around this, I attempted passing the prefix string through the relevant functions instead.

You can see my attempts on [my fork](https://github.com/ayu-ch/git/commits/comment-line-str-4). I think I’ll need to spend more time on this problem and will likely pick up another task alongside it.

Also, my laptop's motherboard died this week. I’m currently using a temporary laptop, but I may need to purchase a new one soon, we’ll see how it goes.
