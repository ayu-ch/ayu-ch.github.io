Hey,
I am Ayush Chandekar, a sophomore at IIT Roorkee. I love exploring all sorts of things, from speedcubing and playing football to listening to music and coding sometimes:)
I like to build cool stuff (and occasionally break some too ðŸ˜‰). I'm always curious to learn about new technologies and whatever piques my interest.
