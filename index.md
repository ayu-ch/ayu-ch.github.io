# Hello there!

I am Ayush, currently a sophomore at IIT Roorkee, with a passion to learn anything which comes my way. You can catch me speed cubing, playing football or headbanging to my favourite playlists. The never-ending spiral of technology and the freedom to create is what intrigues me to dive even deeper.

I created this blog as a little garden, where i can plant my ideas and watch them grow, whether its a concept I learnt or a random idea, this garden is a home for all. Whether you're just starting out or have been exploring your journey for a while, I hope you find something worth your time here!

You can reach me out on mail, feedbacks and suggestions are always welcome :)
